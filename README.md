# Market Basket Dataset Association Rule Mining Using Apriori Algorithm

## Project Overview
This project focuses on discovering meaningful relationships between items in a **Market Basket Dataset** using **Association Rule Mining**.

Association Rule Mining is an **unsupervised data mining technique** widely used in retail and e-commerce to identify frequently purchased item combinations and generate actionable insights.

The **Apriori algorithm** is used to extract frequent itemsets and generate association rules based on support, confidence, and lift measures.

## Objectives
- To analyze transactional market basket data
- To discover frequent itemsets
- To generate association rules between items
- To interpret relationships using support, confidence, and lift

---
